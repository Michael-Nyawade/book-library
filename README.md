# 📚 Book Library

Book Library is a simple web app that lets users search for books and view details using the **Open Library API**.  
It’s part of my **Frontend Development Capstone Project**, built to practice working with APIs, React components, and responsive design.

## 🚀 Features

- Search for books by title or author
- View book cover, title, author, and publisher
- See detailed information about a selected book
- Responsive design (works on desktop and mobile)

## 🛠️ Built With

- **React (Vite)** – for building the user interface
- **Tailwind CSS** – for styling and responsiveness
- **Open Library API** – for fetching book data

## 🧠 Current Progress

Next steps include improving layout alignment, adding a book details page, and refining the UI.
